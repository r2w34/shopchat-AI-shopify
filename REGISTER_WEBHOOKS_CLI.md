## 🚀 Alternative Method: Manual Webhook Registration

If CLI doesn't work, you can register webhooks via API:

### Using curl:

```bash
# Set your variables
export SHOPIFY_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export SHOPIFY_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
export SHOP_DOMAIN="your-store.myshopify.com"
export ACCESS_TOKEN="your_access_token"

# Register customers/data_request webhook
curl -X POST \
  "https://${SHOP_DOMAIN}/admin/api/2025-10/webhooks.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "webhook": {
      "topic": "customers/data_request",
      "address": "https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks/customers/data_request",
      "format": "json"
    }
  }'

# Register customers/redact webhook
curl -X POST \
  "https://${SHOP_DOMAIN}/admin/api/2025-10/webhooks.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "webhook": {
      "topic": "customers/redact",
      "address": "https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks/customers/redact",
      "format": "json"
    }
  }'

# Register shop/redact webhook
curl -X POST \
  "https://${SHOP_DOMAIN}/admin/api/2025-10/webhooks.json" \
  -H "X-Shopify-Access-Token: ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "webhook": {
      "topic": "shop/redact",
      "address": "https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks/shop/redact",
      "format": "json"
