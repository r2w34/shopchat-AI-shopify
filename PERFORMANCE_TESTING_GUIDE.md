### STEP 5: Calculate Performance Impact (3 minutes)

Now calculate the weighted average impact:

**Formula**:
```
Impact = (Home_Before - Home_After) √ó 0.17
       + (Product_Before - Product_After) √ó 0.40
       + (Collection_Before - Collection_After) √ó 0.43
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
BEFORE Scores:
- Home: 85
- Product: 78  
- Collection: 82

AFTER Scores:
- Home: 82
- Product: 75
- Collection: 79

Calculation:
Impact = (85 - 82) √ó 0.17 + (78 - 75) √ó 0.40 + (82 - 79) √ó 0.43
Impact = 3 √ó 0.17 + 3 √ó 0.40 + 3 √ó 0.43
Impact = 0.51 + 1.20 + 1.29
Impact = 3.0 points
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **3.0 points impact** (Less than 10, PASSES!)

1. Lazy load the widget (load only when user interacts)
2. Defer Socket.IO connection
3. Reduce JavaScript bundle size
4. Optimize CSS loading
5. Use code splitting

**Contact**: Let me know and I'll help optimize!

## üéì Tips for Accurate Testing

1. **Clear browser cache** between tests
2. **Use Incognito/Private mode** for consistency
3. **Test same pages** before and after
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** after installation before testing
5. **Run tests 2-3 times** and average the scores if they vary
6. **Use Mobile scores** (they're usually lower and more realistic)
7. **Test during off-peak hours** for consistent network conditions
