### Template 4: Widget Not Showing

Hi [NAME],

Let's troubleshoot why the widget isn't showing on your storefront.

Please check:

1. Is the app installed and active in your Shopify admin?
2. Is the widget enabled in Settings?
3. Does the chat button appear when you visit your store while logged out?
4. Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)

If it's still not working:
- Send me your store URL (yourstore.myshopify.com)
- Let me know which browser you're using
- Send a screenshot if possible

I'll help you get it working!

Best regards,
ShopChat AI Support Team
