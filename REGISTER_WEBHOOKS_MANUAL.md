              └── App setup

                      └── [Add webhook] button
```

---

## 🚨 If You Don't See "Add Webhook" Button

### Alternative: Use API Configuration Tab

4. Look for **"Event subscriptions"** or **"Webhooks"**
5. Click **"Create webhook"** or **"Subscribe to events"**

## 🔄 Alternative Method: Import from TOML

Some Partners Dashboard versions allow importing configuration:

2. Look for **"Import configuration"** or **"Sync from file"**
3. It may auto-detect your `shopify.app.toml` file
4. Click **"Import"** to sync all webhooks at once

---

## 🧪 Test Webhooks (After Registration)

### Option 1: Use Shopify's Test Feature

1. In Partners Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Click on a webhook (e.g., `customers/data_request`)
3. Look for **"Send test webhook"** button
4. Click it
5. Check your server logs: `pm2 logs shopify-ai-chatbot`
6. You should see: "📋 GDPR: Customer data request received"

### Option 2: Test with curl

```bash
# This won't work without valid HMAC, but tests endpoint is reachable
curl -X POST https://shopchatai.indigenservices.com/webhooks/customers/data_request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true}'

# Should return 401 (because no valid HMAC)
# But confirms endpoint exists
```

---

## ✅ After Webhooks Are Registered

### 1. Verify in Dashboard

Go to: Partners Dashboard → Your App → Configuration → Webhooks

You should see at least 3 webhooks listed.

### 2. Resubmit App for Review

1. Go to your app listing
2. Click **"Resubmit for review"**
3. Shopify's automated checker will run again
4. This time it should pass: ✅ "Provides mandatory compliance webhooks"

### 3. Wait for Approval
