## ‚ùå WHAT YOU DON'T NEED (Everything Else)

### Sales Channel Features ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

**Why:** ShopChat AI is a **customer support** app, not a sales channel.

- ‚ùå Your app is a sales channel
- ‚ùå Product Scheduled Publishing
- ‚ùå Sell bundles

**If asked:** "Not applicable - our app is a customer support tool, not a sales channel."

---

### Read All Orders Scope ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

**Why:** The standard `read_orders` scope gives 60 days of order history, which is plenty for order tracking.

**If asked:** 
```
We do not need the read_all_orders scope. The standard read_orders scope 
(60 days) is sufficient for our order tracking feature. Most customers ask 
about recent orders within the last 60 days.
```

---

### Subscriptions APIs ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

**Why:** We use the **Billing API** for app charges, not Subscription APIs for product subscriptions.

**If asked:**
```
Not applicable. We use the Billing API for app subscription charges, not 
Subscription APIs for managing customer product subscriptions. Our app is 
a chat support tool, not a subscription management tool.
```

---

### Payment Features ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

- ‚ùå Access payment mandate scopes
- ‚ùå Request payment processing

**Why:** We don't process any payments. Shopify handles all billing.

**If asked:** "Not applicable - our app does not process payments or collect payment information."

---

### Checkout/Post-Purchase Extensions ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

- ‚ùå Access post-purchase extensions
- ‚ùå Access Chat in checkout extensions
- ‚ùå Allow network access in checkout extensions

**Why:** Our chat widget lives on the storefront, not in checkout.

**If asked:**
```
Not applicable. Our chat widget is embedded on the storefront pages 
(homepage, product pages, etc.), not in the checkout flow. We do not 
use checkout extensions.
```

---

### Reviews/DOM Events ‚ùå NOT NEEDED

- ‚ùå Access standard product reviews
- ‚ùå Access Advanced DOM Events

**Why:** We're a chat app, not a reviews app or analytics app.

**If asked:** "Not applicable - our app does not manage reviews or track DOM events."
