## üìù WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Copy This Checklist)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL (Must Do Before Submission)

```

STEP 2: Test BEFORE installing your app

  a) Home page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/
  b) Product page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/products/[any-product]
  c) Collection page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/collections/[any-collection]

STEP 3: Install your app and test AFTER
- Install ShopChat AI on the test store
- Configure the widget
- Test the SAME 3 pages again on PageSpeed
- Write down the new scores

STEP 4: Calculate the difference
- Home: (Before - After) √ó 0.17
- Product: (Before - After) √ó 0.40
