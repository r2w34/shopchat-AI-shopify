**Response time**: Must complete within 30 days

**Data exported**:
- Customer email
- Total sessions count
- Total messages count
- All chat messages with timestamps
- Session details

---

#### 3.2 Customer Data Deletion (`customers/redact`)

**File**: `app/routes/webhooks.customers.redact.tsx`

**What it does**:
- ✅ Receives deletion request from Shopify

---

#### 3.3 Shop Data Deletion (`shop/redact`)

**File**: `app/routes/webhooks.shop.redact.tsx`

**What it does**:
- ✅ Receives shop deletion request from Shopify
- ✅ Verifies HMAC signature (via `authenticate.webhook`)
- ✅ Finds store record
- ✅ Deletes all chat messages
- ✅ Deletes all chat sessions
- ✅ Deletes all FAQs
- ✅ Deletes all analytics

---

## 🔒 HMAC Signature Verification

**How it works**:

All webhooks use Shopify's official SDK for authentication:

```typescript
const { shop, payload } = await authenticate.webhook(request);
```

**What this does**:
1. ✅ Extracts HMAC signature from request headers
2. ✅ Computes HMAC using app's secret key
3. ✅ Compares signatures (constant-time comparison)
4. ✅ Rejects requests with invalid signatures
5. ✅ Prevents replay attacks
6. ✅ Ensures request authenticity

**Security Level**: ✅ **PRODUCTION-GRADE**

The `@shopify/shopify-app-remix` SDK handles all HMAC verification automatically. This is the recommended approach by Shopify and is more secure than manual implementation.
