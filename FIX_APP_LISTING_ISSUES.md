## üí° Pro Tips

### 1. Keep It Clean
Screenshots should look like they're from a real app, not a marketing brochure.

### 2. Write Naturally
Description should read like you're explaining to a friend, not a keyword-stuffed ad.

### 3. Be Specific
Instead of "Great features" ‚Üí "Handles 1000+ conversations simultaneously"

### 4. Show, Don't Tell
Let features speak for themselves. Don't say "amazing" or "best" - let merchants decide.

### 5. Test on Mobile
Shopify checks mobile view. Make sure your description reads well on phone screens.
