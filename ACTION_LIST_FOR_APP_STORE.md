## 📝 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Copy This Checklist)

### ⚠️ PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL (Must Do Before Submission)

#### 1. Performance Testing (REQUIRED BY SHOPIFY)

**What**: Test that your widget doesn't slow down stores

**How to do it**:

```
STEP 1: Create a test store
- Go to Shopify Partners dashboard
- Create a development store
- Add 10-20 products
- Add 3-5 collections

STEP 2: Test BEFORE installing your app
- Go to https://pagespeed.web.dev/
- Test these 3 pages:
  a) Home page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/
  b) Product page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/products/[any-product]
  c) Collection page: https://your-test-store.myshopify.com/collections/[any-collection]
- Write down the "Performance" scores

STEP 3: Install your app and test AFTER
- Install ShopChat AI on the test store
- Configure the widget
- Test the SAME 3 pages again on PageSpeed
- Write down the new scores

STEP 4: Calculate the difference
- Home: (Before - After) × 0.17
- Product: (Before - After) × 0.40
- Collection: (Before - After) × 0.43

REQUIREMENT: Total Impact must be less than 10 points
