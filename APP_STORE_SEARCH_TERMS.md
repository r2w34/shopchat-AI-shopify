## 🔍 How Shopify Search Works

### Shopify App Store Search Algorithm:

1. **Exact matches** score highest
   - "ai chatbot" search → "ai chatbot" term = highest rank

2. **Partial matches** score next
   - "customer" search → "customer support" term = good rank

3. **Related terms** score lower
   - "help" search → "customer support" term = lower rank

4. **App name** counts most
   - Your app name should include main keywords

### Optimization Tips:

**App Name**: Include 1-2 main keywords
```
Good: "AI Support Chatbot - Customer Service"
Bad: "ShopChat AI Widget Tool"
```

**Subtitle**: Include 2-3 keywords
```
Good: "AI-Powered Live Chat & Order Tracking"
Bad: "The best app ever made"
```
